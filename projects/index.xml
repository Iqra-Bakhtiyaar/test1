      <description>Oct 2017- Apr 2018
On this project I carried out a research on various coins including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Cardano, RChain and fundamental topics of cryptocurrencies. The main purpose was to spread awareness on cryptocurrencies as not many people were aware at that time about uses and abuses of cryptocurrencies. I developed a website for this purpose and to evaluate the project the website was presented to a sample of 30 people and overall response was encouraging and good.</description>

      <description>Mar 2015- Apr 2015
As part of final project of my 1st year in Computer Science I developed software of a robot which could be controlled from a website. The main idea was to control this robot from anywhere around the world. This robot shown in the image could do simple movements such as moving forward, backwards, right, left and in circles.
Following is the website developed in Dr.Racket.  This robot was also equipped with a camera and the output could be seen on the website.</description>
